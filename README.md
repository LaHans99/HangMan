This project will include the topic of Data Processing, creating a project that includes the use of Functional programming along with the various resources this paradigm of programming provides recursion, lists, and files I/O. The project will be created using Elixir
The project to solve is a Hangman type game, the game shall print out a blank space with the number of the letters that each word contains. As an input the Elixir file shall receive a character. 
As an outcome the file shall print the character inputted in the place the letter is set in the word, in case of being set to true in the list. Else the file shall print a strike and the “hangman” will draw a part of the “body”. The player shall have only 5 chances before his “man” is “hanged”. Example. If the file receive the character “a” and the word to evaluate is “Ulisses” the player will gain one strike, but if the the player selects the letter “s” then the output shall read: “_ _ _ s s _ s”
